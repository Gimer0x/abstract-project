## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Never commit `.env` files to version control
- [ ] Use `.env.example` files for documentation
- [ ] Rotate API keys regularly
- [ ] Use different keys for development and production

### File Upload Security
- [ ] Validate file types on both frontend and backend
- [ ] Implement file size limits
- [ ] Scan uploaded files for malware (if needed)
- [ ] Store files in secure locations
- [ ] Implement proper file cleanup

### API Security
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Validate all inputs
- [ ] Use CORS properly
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

### Data Protection
- [ ] Don't store sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Implement proper data retention policies
- [ ] Use secure file deletion
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check for Sensitive Files
```bash
# Check if .env files are being tracked
git ls-files | grep -E "\.env"

# Check if node_modules is being tracked
git ls-files | grep "node_modules"

# Check if uploads directory is being tracked
git ls-files | grep "uploads"

# Check for any API keys in tracked files
git grep -i "api_key\|secret\|password\|token" -- "*.js" "*.json" "*.md"
```

### Test .gitignore
```bash
# Test if .env files are ignored
echo "test" > .env.test
git status
rm .env.test

# Test if node_modules is ignored
mkdir -p node_modules/test
git status
rm -rf node_modules/test
```

## 🚨 Critical Security Items

### Must Never Be Committed
- [ ] OpenAI API keys
- [ ] Database credentials
- [ ] SSL certificates
- [ ] User uploaded files
- [ ] Log files with sensitive data
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations

### Should Be Committed
- [ ] `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- [ ] Source code
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Configuration examples (`.env.example`)
- [ ] Build scripts
- [ ] Test files

## 📋 Pre-commit Checklist

Before committing code:
1. [ ] Check that no `.env` files are staged
2. [ ] Verify no API keys are in the code
3. [ ] Ensure no sensitive data in logs
4. [ ] Check that `node_modules` is not staged
5. [ ] Verify uploads directory is not staged
6. [ ] Review any new files for sensitive information

## 🔧 Security Tools

### Recommended Tools
- **husky**: Pre-commit hooks
- **lint-staged**: Run linters on staged files
- **dotenv-safe**: Ensure required environment variables
- **helmet**: Security headers for Express
- **express-rate-limit**: Rate limiting
- **cors**: CORS configuration

### Example Pre-commit Hook
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check for .env files
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "\.env$"; then
    echo "Error: .env files should not be committed"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for API keys in staged files
if git diff --cached | grep -i "api_key\|secret\|password"; then
    echo "Warning: Potential sensitive data detected"
    exit 1
fi
```

## 📞 Security Contacts

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. **DO** report it privately to the maintainers
3. **DO** provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **DO** wait for acknowledgment before public disclosure

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update security measures as the application evolves.
